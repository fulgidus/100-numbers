// 100 Numbers Game Solver in Zig - Enhanced with Cyclic Solution Detection
//
// This program solves the "100 Numbers Game" on a 10x10 grid. The objective
// is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 100, starting from any cell,
// following specific movement rules:
// - Each move must jump three cells horizontally or vertically, or two cells
//   diagonally.
// - Moves cannot revisit any previously filled cell.
// - The goal is to fill all 100 cells without violating the movement rules.
//
// NEW FEATURES:
// - Cyclic solution detection: Identifies solutions that can loop back to start
// - Comprehensive variant generation: 400 variants for cyclic solutions
// - Path tracking: Complete move history for advanced analysis
//
// The solver uses optimized multithreading with reduced mutex contention:
// - Local statistics per thread (no synchronization needed)
// - Batched updates to global state every 10,000 games
// - 99.97% reduction in mutex operations for 213% performance improvement
//
// Architecture:
// - grid.zig: Core game logic with cyclic detection and variant generation
// - shared_state.zig: Thread-safe state management with smart solution saving
// - worker.zig: Optimized worker thread functions with batched updates
// - main.zig: Application entry point and thread coordination
