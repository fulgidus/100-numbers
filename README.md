# 100 Numbers Game Solver in Zig

A high-performance multithreaded solver for the "100 Numbers Game" written in Zig, capable of finding perfect solutions to this challenging mathematical puzzle.

## 🎯 About the Game

The **100 Numbers Game** is a strategic puzzle played on a 10×10 grid where the objective is to fill all 100 cells with consecutive numbers from 1 to 100, following specific movement rules.

### Game Rules

1. **Starting Position**: Begin from any cell on the 10×10 grid
2. **Movement Rules**: From your current position, you can only move to an empty cell by:
   - Jumping **3 cells** horizontally or vertically (like a chess rook)
   - Jumping **2 cells** diagonally (like a chess bishop)
3. **Numbering**: Fill cells consecutively with numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 100
4. **No Revisiting**: Once a cell is filled, it cannot be used again
5. **Victory Condition**: Successfully fill all 100 cells

### Example Moves
```
From position (5,5), valid moves are:
- Horizontal: (2,5), (8,5)
- Vertical: (5,2), (5,8)  
- Diagonal: (3,3), (7,3), (3,7), (7,7)
```

## 🚀 Why This Project?

This project was born from two passions:

1. **Nostalgia for the Game**: I used to love playing the 100 Numbers Game years ago, and recently rediscovered it. The mathematical elegance and strategic depth of this seemingly simple puzzle reignited my fascination with it.

2. **Learning Zig**: Having heard about Zig's performance characteristics and modern system programming approach, I wanted to dive deep into the language by tackling a computationally intensive problem that would showcase its capabilities.

The combination of a beloved puzzle and an exciting new language made this the perfect learning project.

## 🏗️ Architecture Evolution

The project evolved from a single-file implementation to a well-structured modular architecture:

### Initial Implementation
- **Single-threaded**: Basic Monte Carlo approach with random game simulation
- **Monolithic**: All code in one `main.zig` file
- **Performance**: ~150,000 games per second on a single thread

### Final Architecture
- **Multithreaded**: Utilizes all available CPU cores (24 threads on test system)
- **Modular Design**: Separated into logical modules for maintainability
- **Performance**: Scales linearly with CPU cores

### Module Structure

```
src/
├── main.zig          # Application entry point and thread coordination
├── grid.zig          # Core game logic and grid operations  
├── shared_state.zig  # Thread-safe state management
└── worker.zig        # Worker threads and performance monitoring
```

#### `grid.zig` - Core Game Logic
- `Grid` struct representing the 10×10 game board
- `Move` struct for coordinate changes

- File I/O for solution persistence
- Grid transformations (flip, invert) for solution uniqueness

#### `shared_state.zig` - Concurrency Management
- Thread-safe statistics tracking
- Mutex-protected shared state
- Automatic solution detection and saving
- Performance metrics aggregation

#### `worker.zig` - Parallel Execution
- Worker thread implementation for continuous game simulation
- Performance monitoring and reporting
- Graceful error handling

#### `main.zig` - Orchestration
- Thread pool management
- CPU core detection and optimal thread allocation
- Application lifecycle management

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Benchmarks
- **Single-threaded**: ~150,000 games/second
- **24-core system (original)**: ~1,900,000 games/second (53% efficiency)
- **24-core system (optimized)**: ~5,900,000 games/second (396% efficiency)
- **Theoretical maximum**: ~3,600,000 games/second (150k × 24 cores)
- **Memory usage**: Minimal, each thread uses ~1KB for grid state
- **Solution detection**: Automatic with hash-based deduplication

### 🎯 Performance Breakthrough
The optimized version achieves **5.9 million games/second** - exceeding theoretical expectations by implementing batched statistics updates and reducing mutex contention by 99.9%.

### 🚧 Performance Bottleneck Analysis

The multithreaded version achieves only **53% efficiency** instead of linear scaling due to:

#### **1. Mutex Contention (Primary Bottleneck)**
```zig
// Every single game calls this function = 1.9M mutex locks/second!
pub fn updateScore(self: *SharedState, score: u32, grid: *const Grid) void {
    self.mutex.lock();  // ← BOTTLENECK: 24 threads competing for this lock
    defer self.mutex.unlock();
    
    self.games_played += 1;  // Simple increment but under mutex
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Impact**: Each of the 1.9 million games requires mutex acquisition, creating massive contention.

#### **2. I/O Operations Under Mutex**
- Console output for new best scores
- File I/O for perfect solutions  
- Grid printing operations

#### **3. Memory Bandwidth Saturation**
- 24 cores accessing shared memory simultaneously
- Cache line bouncing between CPU cores
- Random number generation overhead

### 🔧 Optimization Strategies

#### **Batched Updates Approach**
```zig
// Instead of updating per game, batch every 10,000 games
pub fn updateLocalScore(self: *LocalStats, score: u32, grid: *const Grid) void {
    self.games_played += 1;  // No mutex needed - local to thread
    
    if (self.games_played % 10000 == 0) {
        shared_state.flushLocalStats(self);  // Mutex only every 10k games
    }
}
```

**Expected Improvement**: 95%+ reduction in mutex contention → ~80% efficiency

#### **Lock-Free Atomic Operations**
```zig
// Use atomic operations for simple counters
pub const AtomicSharedState = struct {
    games_played: std.atomic.Value(u64),  // No mutex needed
    best_score: std.atomic.Value(u32),
    // Only use mutex for complex operations
};
```

#### **Thread-Local Storage**
- Each thread maintains private statistics
- Periodic synchronization instead of per-game
- Reduces cache line bouncing

### Performance Comparison
| Version       | Games/Second  | Efficiency | Mutex Ops/Second | Performance Gain |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Original      | 1,900,000     | 53%        | 1,900,000        | Baseline         |
| **Optimized** | **5,943,579** | **396%**   | **594**          | **+213%**        |

**Key Improvements Achieved:**
- **99.97% reduction** in mutex operations (1.9M → 594 per second)
- **213% performance increase** through batched updates
- **Superior scaling** beyond theoretical single-thread × cores

### Algorithm Details
The solver uses a **Monte Carlo approach** with several optimizations:

1. **Random Starting Points**: Each game begins from a randomly selected cell
2. **Greedy Move Selection**: From current position, randomly select from all valid moves
3. **Early Termination**: Games end when no valid moves remain
4. **Solution Persistence**: Perfect solutions (100/100) are automatically saved
5. **Duplicate Detection**: Uses hash-based deduplication across 4 orientations

### Why This Approach Works
- **Exploration Diversity**: Random starting points ensure comprehensive search space coverage
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Independent game simulations scale perfectly across cores
- **Solution Rarity**: Perfect solutions are extremely rare, making brute force viable
- **Hash Optimization**: Quick duplicate detection prevents redundant solution storage
