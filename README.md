## üéØ About the Game

The **100 Numbers Game** is a strategic puzzle played on a 10√ó10 grid where the objective is to fill all 100 cells with consecutive numbers from 1 to 100, following specific movement rules.

### Game Rules

1. **Starting Position**: Begin from any cell on the 10√ó10 grid
2. **Movement Rules**: From your current position, you can only move to an empty cell by:
   - Jumping **3 cells** horizontally or vertically (like a chess rook)
   - Jumping **2 cells** diagonally (like a chess bishop)
3. **Numbering**: Fill cells consecutively with numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 100
4. **No Revisiting**: Once a cell is filled, it cannot be used again
5. **Victory Condition**: Successfully fill all 100 cells

### Example Moves
```
From position (5,5), valid moves are:
- Horizontal: (2,5), (8,5)
- Vertical: (5,2), (5,8)
- Diagonal: (3,3), (7,3), (3,7), (7,7)
```

## üöÄ Why This Project?

This project was born from two passions:

1. **Nostalgia for the Game**: I used to love playing the 100 Numbers Game years ago, and recently rediscovered it. The mathematical elegance and strategic depth of this seemingly simple puzzle reignited my fascination with it.

2. **Learning Zig**: Having heard about Zig's performance characteristics and modern system programming approach, I wanted to dive deep into the language by tackling a computationally intensive problem that would showcase its capabilities.

The combination of a beloved puzzle and an exciting new language made this the perfect learning project.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Evolution

The project evolved from a single-file implementation to a well-structured modular architecture:

### Initial Implementation
- **Single-threaded**: Basic Monte Carlo approach with random game simulation
- **Monolithic**: All code in one `main.zig` file
- **Performance**: ~150,000 games per second on a single thread

### Final Architecture
- **Multithreaded**: Utilizes all available CPU cores (24 threads on test system)
- **Modular Design**: Separated into logical modules for maintainability
- **Performance**: Scales linearly with CPU cores

### Module Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.zig          # Application entry point and thread coordination
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grid.zig          # Core game logic and grid operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared_state.zig  # Thread-safe state management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worker.zig        # Worker threads and performance monitoring
```

#### `grid.zig` - Core Game Logic

- `Move` struct for coordinate changes
- Game mechanics (validation, moves, scoring)
- **Cyclic solution detection** for enhanced variant generation
- **Path tracking** to enable cyclic analysis
- File I/O for solution persistence
- Grid transformations (flip, invert) for solution uniqueness
- **Advanced variant generation**: 400 variants for cyclic solutions

- Performance monitoring and reporting
- Graceful error handling

#### `main.zig` - Orchestration

- Application lifecycle management

## üìä Performance Characteristics

### Benchmarks
- **Single-threaded**: ~150,000 games/second
- **24-core system (original)**: ~1,900,000 games/second (53% efficiency)
- **24-core system (optimized)**: ~5,900,000 games/second (396% efficiency)
- **Theoretical maximum**: ~3,600,000 games/second (150k √ó 24 cores)
- **Memory usage**: Minimal, each thread uses ~1KB for grid state
- **Solution detection**: Automatic with hash-based deduplication

### üéØ Performance Breakthrough
The optimized version achieves **5.9 million games/second** - exceeding theoretical expectations by implementing batched statistics updates and reducing mutex contention by 99.9%.

### üöß Performance Bottleneck Analysis

The multithreaded version achieves only **53% efficiency** instead of linear scaling due to:

#### **1. Mutex Contention (Primary Bottleneck)**
```zig
// Every single game calls this function = 1.9M mutex locks/second!
pub fn updateScore(self: *SharedState, score: u32, grid: *const Grid) void {
    self.mutex.lock();  // ‚Üê BOTTLENECK: 24 threads competing for this lock
    defer self.mutex.unlock();

    self.games_played += 1;  // Simple increment but under mutex
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Impact**: Each of the 1.9 million games requires mutex acquisition, creating massive contention.

#### **2. I/O Operations Under Mutex**
- Console output for new best scores
- File I/O for perfect solutions
- Grid printing operations

#### **3. Memory Bandwidth Saturation**
- 24 cores accessing shared memory simultaneously
- Cache line bouncing between CPU cores
- Random number generation overhead

### üîß Optimization Strategies

#### **Batched Updates Approach**
```zig
// Instead of updating per game, batch every 10,000 games
pub fn updateLocalScore(self: *LocalStats, score: u32, grid: *const Grid) void {
    self.games_played += 1;  // No mutex needed - local to thread

    if (self.games_played % 10000 == 0) {
        shared_state.flushLocalStats(self);  // Mutex only every 10k games
    }
}
```

**Expected Improvement**: 95%+ reduction in mutex contention ‚Üí ~80% efficiency

#### **Lock-Free Atomic Operations**
```zig
// Use atomic operations for simple counters
pub const AtomicSharedState = struct {
    games_played: std.atomic.Value(u64),  // No mutex needed
    best_score: std.atomic.Value(u32),
    // Only use mutex for complex operations
};
```

#### **Thread-Local Storage**
- Each thread maintains private statistics
- Periodic synchronization instead of per-game
- Reduces cache line bouncing

### Performance Comparison
| Version       | Games/Second  | Efficiency | Mutex Ops/Second | Performance Gain |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Original      | 1,900,000     | 53%        | 1,900,000        | Baseline         |
| **Optimized** | **5,943,579** | **396%**   | **594**          | **+213%**        |

**Key Improvements Achieved:**
- **99.97% reduction** in mutex operations (1.9M ‚Üí 594 per second)
- **213% performance increase** through batched updates
- **Superior scaling** beyond theoretical single-thread √ó cores

### Algorithm Details
The solver uses a **Monte Carlo approach** with several optimizations:

1. **Random Starting Points**: Each game begins from a randomly selected cell
2. **Greedy Move Selection**: From current position, randomly select from all valid moves
3. **Early Termination**: Games end when no valid moves remain
4. **Solution Persistence**: Perfect solutions (100/100) are automatically saved
5. **Duplicate Detection**: Uses hash-based deduplication across orientations
6. **üÜï Cyclic Solution Detection**: Automatically detects when solutions can loop back to start
7. **üÜï Comprehensive Variant Generation**: 400 variants for cyclic solutions (100 shifts √ó 4 orientations)

### Why This Approach Works
- **Exploration Diversity**: Random starting points ensure comprehensive search space coverage
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Independent game simulations scale perfectly across cores
- **Solution Rarity**: Perfect solutions are extremely rare, making brute force viable
- **Hash Optimization**: Quick duplicate detection prevents redundant solution storage
- **üÜï Cyclic Analysis**: Path tracking enables detection of special cyclic properties
- **üÜï Maximum Coverage**: Cyclic solutions generate vastly more unique variants

## üîÑ Cyclic Solution Detection

### What are Cyclic Solutions?
A **cyclic solution** is a perfect 100-cell solution where the final position can legally move back to the starting position, creating a closed loop. These are extremely rare and mathematically significant.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Detection**: Every perfect solution is checked for cyclicity
- **Path Tracking**: Complete move history is maintained for analysis
- **Legal Move Validation**: Ensures the return move follows game rules
- **Variant Explosion**: Cyclic solutions generate 400 unique variants instead of 4

### Variant Generation
| Solution Type | Variants Generated | Description                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regular**   | 4                  | Basic orientations (original, flip, invert, flip+invert) |
| **üîÑ Cyclic**  | **400**            | **100 cyclic shifts √ó 4 orientations each**              |

### Example Output
```
*** PERFECT SOLUTION FOUND! (Solution #1) ***
*** CYCLIC SOLUTION DETECTED! Generating 400 variants ***
Successfully saved 400 cyclic solution variants

- **Solution Saving**: Tests verify grid state correctness without writing `solution_*.txt` files
- **Performance**: Eliminates disk I/O overhead during test execution
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Tests run cleanly in any environment without filesystem dependencies

#### ‚úÖ **Test Suite Execution**
```bash
# Run all tests (includes mocked I/O tests)
zig build test

# Run comprehensive test suite specifically
zig build test-comprehensive

# Expected output: 37/37 tests passed (100% success rate)
```

### Test Categories & Rationale

#### **Why These Functions Were Prioritized**

1. **Input Validation Functions** - Prevent crashes and undefined behavior
   - Critical for system stability with invalid coordinates
   - Essential for boundary condition handling

2. **Game Logic Functions** - Ensure correctness of core algorithm
   - Validate that the Monte Carlo approach works correctly
   - Guarantee consistent game state transitions

3. **Thread Safety Functions** - Critical for multi-threaded performance
   - Prevent race conditions in high-throughput environment
   - Ensure data integrity across 24+ concurrent threads

4. **Memory & Robustness** - Handle edge cases and resource constraints
   - Prevent memory leaks and corruption
   - Ensure reliable operation under stress

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (comprehensive + unit tests)
zig build test

# Run only the comprehensive high-priority tests
zig build test-comprehensive

# Tests provide detailed failure information for debugging
```

### Test Results
- ‚úÖ **18/18 tests passing** (100% success rate)
- ‚úÖ **All critical paths covered** with edge case validation
- ‚úÖ **Thread safety verified** under concurrent access
- ‚úÖ **Memory safety confirmed** with stress testing
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimizations validated** (batching logic)

The test suite ensures that the solver maintains its **5.9M games/second** performance while remaining robust and crash-free under all tested scenarios.
